# Dayz Radio Discord Bot

## Installation

To install this program, you will need Python and git
* https://github.com/git-guides/install-git
* https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once both installed, make a folder which will contain the program, open the terminal on the folder location and run
```sh
git clone https://github.com/dogevroum/dayz_radio_discord_bot.git
```

## Troubleshooting

If you have any trouble to use my program, simply contact me on Discord, my username is `dogevr`

## Customisation

You can easily edit alot of settings for the bot

In order to do this, open "bot.py" in your favorite IDE, if you don't have one, I recommend you Visual Studio Code : https://code.visualstudio.com/download

All the settings are from to line 8 to line 26
